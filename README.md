This challenge was an exercise in using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze data taken from two separate csv files. This analysis consisted of using creating as well as using specific given codes to create and manipulate multiple dataframes. These data frames were then used to highlight specific data values for easier comparison, as well as to determine influencing factors for others. An example of this is the dataframe that isolated the average math score by grade, per school. This was done by using groupby to reorganize the data in accordance to specific factors. From there, each dataframe was read and run through various calculations to complete new ones. Returning the previous example, this would be how the original dataframe was grouped by grade, then school name, before the average math scores were calculated out per academic grade.
